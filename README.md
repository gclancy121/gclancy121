### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Gage Clancy. I'm a new Fullstack Web Dev, about to graduate from Bloomtech. 

I'm currently working on: making a new project to flesh out my resume.
I'm interested in: Being a Backend or Fullstack Web Dev, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, video games, and anime.

One of my favorite games right now: The Long Dark. It's an indie survival game where you try and survive in a post-apocalypse northern Canada, and it's very relaxed. It helps me unwind after a long day of coding. 

One of my favorite anime: Spice and Wolf. It made learning about economics enjoyable, and the main girl is very cute. 

If you have any questions for me, please email me at gclancy121@gmail.com!
